Note

This project is deprecated. Because it has many problems (training method, loss function, data augmentation, multi-scale training, etc.), which I have not solved so far, so it can only get 45% mAP on the VOC2007 dataset. Please see YOLO3 https://github.com/Stinky-Tofu/YOLO_V3, which get 88.3% mAP on the VOC2007 dataset, and I will continue to improve YOLO3 with the latest papers.
